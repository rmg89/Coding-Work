        <h2> Evidence #4 </h2>

        <p> Pulling from her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_(singer)">Wikipedia Bio</a> we see true
            examples of her queendom, with the following excerpts as reference: </p>

        <p>"Pink has been described as "pop royalty" for her distinctive raspy voice and acrobatic stage
            presence. She has sold over 135 million records worldwide (60 million albums and 75 million singles), making
            her one of the world's best-selling music artists. Pink is also the most-played female solo artist in the
            United Kingdom during the 21st century." </p>

        <p> "James Montgomery of MTV calls her "a deceptively good singer ... who can out-sing almost anyone". The
            Guardian called her voice "prodigious". Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times labeled her "a powerhouse
            vocalist". Pink has also been noted for her "raw", "soulful" voice and her ability to emote. The
            Inquirer called her voice "husky" and "gutsy", and wrote that she had developed into a "powerfully emotive
            vocalist", comparing her to Janis Joplin." </p>

        <p> And as a queer man writing this Thesis, I have to include this passage, which only highlights one facet of
            P!nk's philanthropic work:

            <br>
            <br>

            "Pink is also outspoken about LGBT rights and supports same-sex marriage. In her 2006 song "Dear Mr.
            President", she criticized then-President George Bush's opposition to gay marriage, singing: "What kind of
            father would hate his own daughter if she were gay?". In November 2008, Pink marched against
            Proposition 8, a proposition to ban gay marriage, at a rally in downtown Los Angeles. The singer was
            awarded with the "Ally for Equality Award" at the Human Rights Campaign Dinner in 2010. In 2012, she told
            The Advocate that she had girlfriends in her twenties but does not define her sexual orientation, saying, "I
            never felt the need to." In the same interview, the
            singer mentioned her appreciation for her lesbian and bisexual female fans. In 2023, Billboard named her
            song "Raise Your Glass" as one of the top LGBT Anthems of All Time at number 31. In an interview with
            Gay Times, Pink stated that the queer community means "everything to her". She added: "I think [my LGBTQ+
            following] just speaks to who I am and what I believe in, and what I've always been. I am definitely an ally
            and to be understood for that is a wonderful feeling. For any of us to be understood, that's what we want in
            life, right? We want to love, be loved and be seen.""
